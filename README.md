- Custom Piper TTS executable with daemon and speed parameter support
- Voice models (https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main)
- eSpeak-ng data files for phonemization
- NAudio library for high-quality audio playback

## Architecture

### Custom Piper Daemon
The application uses a heavily modified Piper TTS executable with enhanced daemon mode and performance optimizations:

- **Daemon startup**: `piper.exe --model "model.onnx" --espeak_data "path" --daemon`
- **Enhanced request format**: JSON `{"text": "Hello world", "speed": 7}`
- **Response format**: 4-byte size header + raw PCM audio data
- **Persistent model**: Loaded once in memory for sub-second response times
- **Speed parameter support**: Integer values 1-10 (higher = faster) instead of decimal length_scale
- **Performance optimizations**: Tensor pooling, phoneme caching, and intelligent chunking

### Advanced Processing Pipeline
1. **Text input** via clipboard monitoring with pause/resume control
2. **Intelligent text chunking** with sentence boundary detection and optimal sizing
3. **Asynchronous phonemization** with LRU word-level caching
4. **Enhanced daemon requests** with speed control and JSON protocol
5. **Tensor pooling** for efficient memory management
6. **Streaming audio generation** with sentence-level callbacks
7. **PCM to WAV conversion** in memory with immediate NAudio playback

## Configuration

The application automatically locates required files and supports comprehensive customization:

### File Locations
